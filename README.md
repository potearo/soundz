## Overview

Soundz is a powerful sound effects wrapper designed specifically for components in React and Next.js applications. It allows developers to easily integrate sound effects into their projects, enhancing user experience and engagement. This library supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, making it versatile for a range of applications.

## Features

- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that sound effects can be used without hindering the user experience.
- **Batteries Included**: Comes with a set of pre-defined sound effects that you can use out of the box.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and add your own sound effects to suit your project's needs.
- **Component Library**: Designed as a component library, making it simple to integrate with existing React and Next.js projects.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead ensures that your application remains fast and responsive.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across various platforms, including web and mobile.

## Installation

To get started with Soundz, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install soundz
```

For Yarn users, you can run:

```bash
yarn add soundz
```

## Usage

To use Soundz in your project, import the necessary components and sound effects. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
import { SoundButton } from 'soundz';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SoundButton sound="click" label="Click Me" />
  );
};
```

This code will render a button that plays a "click" sound effect when clicked.

## Components

Soundz includes several key components that make it easy to work with sound effects:

- **SoundButton**: A button that plays a sound effect on click.
- **SoundPlayer**: A component that allows for more complex sound interactions.
- **SoundContext**: Provides a context for managing sound settings across your application.

### SoundButton

The `SoundButton` component is the simplest way to integrate sound effects. You can customize it with different sounds and labels.

```javascript
<SoundButton sound="success" label="Success!" />
```

### SoundPlayer

The `SoundPlayer` component is designed for more advanced use cases. It allows you to control playback, volume, and other settings.

```javascript
<SoundPlayer sound="background-music" loop={true} />
```

### SoundContext

Use the `SoundContext` to manage global sound settings. This is useful for applications where sound preferences need to be consistent across components.

```javascript
import { SoundContext } from 'soundz';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SoundContext.Provider value={{ volume: 0.5 }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </SoundContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## Accessibility

Soundz emphasizes accessibility. It ensures that sound effects do not interfere with users who may have hearing impairments. Here are some best practices:

- Provide visual cues alongside sound effects.
- Allow users to toggle sound effects on and off.
- Ensure that sound effects do not play automatically without user interaction.

## Customization

You can easily customize the sound effects in Soundz. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Add Your Own Sounds**: Simply import your sound files and use them in the components.

```javascript
import mySound from './sounds/my-sound.mp3';

<SoundButton sound={mySound} label="Play My Sound" />
```

2. **Adjust Volume**: Control the volume for each sound effect.

```javascript
<SoundButton sound="click" volume={0.7} label="Click Me" />
```

3. **Change Playback Speed**: Modify the playback speed for unique effects.

```javascript
<SoundButton sound="fast-click" speed={1.5} label="Fast Click" />
```

## Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate the capabilities of Soundz:

### Basic Button with Sound

```javascript
import { SoundButton } from 'soundz';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SoundButton sound="click" label="Click Me" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Sound Player with Background Music

```javascript
import { SoundPlayer } from 'soundz';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SoundPlayer sound="background-music" loop={true} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Context Provider for Global Settings

```javascript
import { SoundContext } from 'soundz';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SoundContext.Provider value={{ volume: 0.5 }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </SoundContext.Provider>
  );
};
```
